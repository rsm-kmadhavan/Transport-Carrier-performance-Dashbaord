Carrier Departure Precision & Carriers Departure Precision Trend

These visuals evaluate how well carriers are adhering to on-time departures, both at a granular level (individual carriers) and over time (monthly trends). It helps identify carriers with consistently low precision to improve performance.

Sites Ready Precision & Site Performance Comparison

These visuals focus on site readiness and compare precision metrics across sites. By analyzing trends over months and comparing readiness versus departure precision, the visuals highlight specific sites that need attention for operational improvements.

Overall Ready Precision % & Overall Departure Precision %

These key metrics summarize the overall performance of readiness and departures, giving a quick snapshot of operational efficiency across all sites and carriers.
Data Table

The detailed data table supports granular analysis by listing shipment details such as site, carrier, departure precision, and timestamps, allowing users to investigate specific cases of delays or discrepancies.
